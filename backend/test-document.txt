AI and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Key Concepts:
- Deep Learning uses neural networks with multiple layers
- Natural Language Processing helps computers understand human language
- Computer Vision enables machines to interpret visual information

Applications:
AI is used in various fields including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. Self-driving cars, recommendation systems, and virtual assistants are all powered by AI technology.

The future of AI looks promising with ongoing research in areas like quantum computing, edge AI, and explainable AI systems.
